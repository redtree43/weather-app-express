WEATHER APP

Display a 5-day weather forecast, where each day shows the high and low temperatures, and an image for sunny/rainy/cloudy/snowy. Use fake, hard-coded data until you’ve got everything rendering correctly.


You might notice that the “days” look a lot like the cards from today’s morning challenge
For added practice:
* Add the ability to click on a day, and see its hourly forecast. You can just maintain the current view in the top-level App state.
* Add React Router to the project (npm install react-router) and follow the quick start guide here to add routes, such that / shows the 5-day forecast, and /[name-of-day] shows the hourly forecast for a particular day.
* Sign up for a free API key from Open Weather Map, fetch a real 5-day forecast, and feed that data into your app.
* Want to get really fancy? Add a graphics library  to render a graph of the temperature over the course of a week or day.
* concentrate on the aspects you are looking to brush up on
* if you don’t want to do a weather api, you are free to use another one you prefer. (edited)
